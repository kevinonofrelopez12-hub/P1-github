# Kevin Onofre Lopez | Personal GitHub Project
###### Academic Project for Educational Purposes

This project represents my initial deep dive into the fundamental concepts of **Git and GitHub**. My primary goal is to master version control, distributed collaboration, and the essential software development tools that define modern workflows. As noted, this repository serves a purely educational purpose, acting as a technical log of my exploration into these technologies.

### Essential Git Commands
I have curated and organized the following commands as the "core toolkit" for managing a project's lifecycle. These allow for everything from repository initialization to seamless team collaboration.

| Function | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `git init` | Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. |
| `git clone` | Downloads an existing project from a remote server to the local machine. |
| `git status` | Displays file status, indicating modified and staged changes. |
| `git add .` | Stages all modified files at once for the next commit. |
| `git commit -m "message"` | Saves changes locally with a descriptive progress message. |
| `git push` | Uploads committed changes to the remote repository. |
| `git pull` | Fetches and merges the latest changes from the remote server. |
| `git branch` | Lists all active branches within the project. |
| `git switch` | The modern, optimized command for toggling between branches. |

### Tech Stack & Tools

The tools listed below represent the core technologies I am utilizing to master data extraction and interpretation processes.

| Tool | Primary Application |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Python** | Data analysis and process automation |
| **R / RStudio** | Statistical analysis and scientific visualization |
| **MySQL** | Structured relational data management |
| **MongoDB** | Unstructured or semi-structured NoSQL data |

#### Tool Breakdown:

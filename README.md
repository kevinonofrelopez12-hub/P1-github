# Kevin Onofre Lopez | Personal GitHub Project
###### Academic Project for Educational Purposes

This project represents my initial deep dive into the fundamental concepts of **Git and GitHub**. My primary goal is to master version control, distributed collaboration, and the essential software development tools that define modern workflows. As noted, this repository serves a purely educational purpose, acting as a technical log of my exploration into these technologies.

### Essential Git Commands
I have curated and organized the following commands as the "core toolkit" for managing a project's lifecycle. These allow for everything from repository initialization to seamless team collaboration.

| Function | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `git init` | Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. |
| `git clone` | Downloads an existing project from a remote server to the local machine. |
| `git status` | Displays file status, indicating modified and staged changes. |
| `git add .` | Stages all modified files at once for the next commit. |
| `git commit -m "message"` | Saves changes locally with a descriptive progress message. |
| `git push` | Uploads committed changes to the remote repository. |
| `git pull` | Fetches and merges the latest changes from the remote server. |
| `git branch` | Lists all active branches within the project. |
| `git switch` | The modern, optimized command for toggling between branches. |

### Tech Stack & Tools

The tools listed below represent the core technologies I am utilizing to master data extraction and interpretation processes.

| Tool | Primary Application |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Python** | Data analysis and process automation |
| **R / RStudio** | Statistical analysis and scientific visualization |
| **MySQL** | Structured relational data management |
| **MongoDB** | Unstructured or semi-structured NoSQL data |

### Conclusion & Future Roadmap

In conclusion, this project provides the fundamental groundwork for understanding version control systems and essential development tools. Future iterations will expand upon these concepts through practical implementations and real-world use cases, integrating more complex data analysis.

> **Project Status:** This is a work in progress and will evolve over time. This initial phase is strictly for educational exploration.
